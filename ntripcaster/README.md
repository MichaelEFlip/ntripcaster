This is a mirror of BKG Ntrip Caster V1, made available for download convenience.

I do not use this software anymore, as it supports Ntrip protocol V1 only.

I have developed a NTRIP V2 Caster for OEM integration

Features

- NTRIP V1 and V2 compatible
- Support for NEAREAST style mountpoints selected via client NMEA string
- **Unlimited servers, mountpoints and clients**
- **Single thread high performance implementation**
- MySQL interface for configuration and logging
